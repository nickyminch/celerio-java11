TODO before Celerio 4.0.1 release:

* adapt all poms so we can deploy on maven central
* in bootstrap-maven-plugin/pom.xml, enable matrix IT, make it skippable easily
* migrate more ITs from our private repository
* replace the test CelerioLoaderTest (currently ignored) by another one
* change branding code (no longer need to accept the license)
